cellardoor
==========

Create ReST APIs like you've always wanted.

**cellardoor** is a framework for modeling data and ReST services. It aims to make CRUD less soul-crushingly repetitive while still providing clear, simple ways for the developer to integrate all the non-CRUDy parts of her or his API. The default configuration uses `MongoDB <http://www.mongodb.com/>`_ and `Falcon <http://falconframework.org/>`_ to provide flexible persistence and top-notch performance. Many other configurations are possible.

Some features of **cellardoor**

* **Declarative everything:** entities, operations, authorization, data validation
* **Pluggable everything:** storage, serializers, authentication, even protocol
* A simple but powerful system of **hooks**
* Generate **JSON schema** from your model
